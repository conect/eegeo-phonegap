### API Key 

In order to use the eeGeo 3D Maps API, you must sign up for a free developer account at https://www.eegeo.com/developers. After signing up, you'll be able to create an [API key](https://www.eegeo.com/developers/apikeys) for your apps.

###Building PhoneGap on various platforms:

#####Android Build

1. Open terminal and add navigate to <PROJECT> directory

2.  **$ phonegap build android**

3. Import <PROJECT>/platforms/android in Android Studio and run

4. Additional step for Android to fix screen density issues - change the main Activity class in the project to include the following code snippet:

````@Override
   public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
   {
       super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
       loadUrl(launchUrl);
       CordovaWebViewEngine engine = appView.getEngine();
       SystemWebView webView = (SystemWebView)engine.getView();
       WebSettings settings = webView.getSettings();
       settings.setUseWideViewPort(true);
       settings.setLoadWithOverviewMode(true);
   }
   ````
Note: Requisite support for Chrome 38 WebGL is present only in Android 5.0+.
